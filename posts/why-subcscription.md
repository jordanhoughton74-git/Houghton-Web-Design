At Houghton Web Design, our ultimate aim has always been to empower small and medium-sized companies, like yours, in creating a strong online presence that propels your growth and success. 

When it comes to choosing the right company, we understand that most businesses have three important factors in mind: cost, quality, and maintenance.
- The cost needs to be right to meet the needs of all types of industries including start-ups.
- The quality needs to be first rate and fast enough that potential customers will not be lost.
- The website needs to be maintained often, many companies prefer to focus on what they do best and leave that side to me.

**How can we solve them?**

This is where our subscription model comes into play! With our affordable pricing starting at just Â£35 a month, you can have a fully bespoke website tailored to meet your company's needs. The best part? Our packages also include monthly maintenance time. In fact, our starter package offers 30 minutes of maintenance each month! This allows me to assist you in updating your website with fresh content, making adjustments to images and layouts, and ensuring everything runs smoothly. If you require additional changes beyond the allocated time, no worries! I'll be more than happy to provide you with a low-cost quote to fulfil your specific requirements. Our aim is to provide you with the flexibility and support you need, all at a price that fits your budget.

**What package is best for you?**

For most small companies, we highly recommend our starter package. It provides everything you need to establish your online presence, and I'll personally handle all the technical aspects, including submitting your site to Google. It's a hassle-free solution that allows you to focus on your business while we take care of the rest.
However, if you have a business that frequently undergoes changes or if you prefer to have more control over the wording and content of your website on an ongoing basis, our Performance package might be the perfect fit for you. The main advantage of this package is the inclusion of a content management system (CMS). With a CMS, you'll have the freedom to make changes to the wording and content of your website whenever you like, without relying on external assistance. It empowers you to tinker and customise your website as per your preference and evolving needs.
Ultimately, the choice between the starter package and the performance package depends on your specific requirements and preferences.


For any businesses looking to get online and dip into commerce the ecommerce package is perfect for them.  It includes everything you'd need to make your first sale!
